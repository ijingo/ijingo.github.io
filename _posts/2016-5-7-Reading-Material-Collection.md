This blog is a small storage room of serveral valuable reading materials in
various aspects, including but not limited to programming skills,
database techniques, computer science foreland, and even sentiments of life.
If needed in the future, I may separate these categories into dedicated pages.

## Sentiments of Life

* [新生大学 Newborn University](b.xinshengdaxue.com) (in Chinese)

One can live more than one lives as long as he is willing to. It takes about
7 years to master something. If you live to be 88, after age 11, you have 11
opportunities to be great at something. These are the lifetimes more than one.
